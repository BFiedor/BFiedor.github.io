            <div id="photoBio">
                <p1>Junkyard Wars was a challenge of Creativity. Could you come up with an idea that could solve a problem from Junk?
                    <br><br>
                    With Bottles, straws, a rolling pin, wood, spoons, and metal rods, we came up with a Hydropowered car on a track that will drip water onto plants beneath it.
                    <br>
                    We made the wheels out of the rolling pin. The spoons and a bottle cap became our gears. The metal rod + Straws were our axles. And of course the water was held in the bottles.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, our car was relatively successful, however due to gluing issues, our wheels & axles did not align correctly overnight resulting in misaligned wheel rotations.
