                    This class certainly pushed me out of my comfort zone by a couple state lines.
                    <br><br> I am more of an introverted person, therefore it took a lot for me to go out and pursue business acquisitions in Crash & Burn or go out and sell to the public.
                    <br><br> Presentations in front of real professional judges was terrifying yet exhilarating. I thoroughly enjoy constructive criticism as it provides me with a means to more success in what I am working on. I applaud all of my team members as I could not have done it without their help.
                    <br><br> All of my other team projects in other classes resulted in me doing about 90% of the work, however, this class contains true leaders who are brilliant, efficient, and dedicated towards professionalism and perfection. I could not have asked for better teammates in these competitions. I remember coming out of our New Business Competition presentation telling my team that we did amazing and how proud I was of the work we put in.
                    <br><br> Overall, this class challenged me, which made it fun and exciting. It took a lot of my time that resulted in exceptional joy upon completion. And lastly, it helped me feel more comfortable with the challenges I will face as I progress into my own career.
