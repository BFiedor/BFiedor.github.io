            <div id="photoBio">
                <p1>For this project, we were tasked with coming up with a new food recipe, make it and bring it into class.
                    <br><br>
                    My first idea was a desert as you hear about new deserts being made all of the time while other foods seemed to have reached their limit of new ideas with what is available.
                    This is where I came up with the idea of Lemon Chocolates. There are lemon tarts, pies, or other lemon chocolate products, but none of them have a real lemon within them that contains the sour juices.
                    <br><br>
                    This is where the masterpiece that was Dark Chocolate with a center of lemon chunks came into existence. The bitterness of the dark chocolate cancels out the sourness from the lemon which left myself and my classmates surprised with how delectable it was.
