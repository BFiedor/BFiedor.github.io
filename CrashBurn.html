            <div id="photoBio">
                <p1>The Crash & Burn Competition was a way for my team and I to make money in any way possible.
                    <br><br>
                    We began by brainstorming for ideas, straying away from food related items and focusing more on a product/service that could assist a local business which has money. This led to our first idea which was advertising in the form of water bottles.
                    <br><br>
                    Most people will receive paper advertising and just throw them away. However, with an piece of advertising that you can use(drink). There is more times to see the ad and persuade you to go there. To further this persuasion, my team and I added discounts (with permission from the businesses) to incentive customers to go the business.
                    <br><br>
                    Our second idea was Care Packages. My teammate Wyatt, had excess care packages within his organization so we were able to repurpose these unused products and sell them for vast profit with little cost.
                    <br><br>
                    My team ended up coming in first with $2,118.45 in profit.
