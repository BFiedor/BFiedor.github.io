            <div id="photoBio">
                <p1>The New Business Competition was about developing a business idea and plan.
                    <br><br>
                    The most difficult part about this competition was coming up with an actual business idea. This is a task that many teams struggle with and once you thought of a good idea, you soon find out that it already exists in some manner. It took quite some time until we discovered an untapped market which is protection via Direct Messaging.
                    <br><br>
                    My team and I came up with ProteXt which is an application that utilizes Bumble's Machine Learning Privacy Detector to look for explicit photos upon direct messaging and will block or blur these images from the user for their protection.
                    <br><br>
                    After a presentation in front of judges, my team came in 3rd overall out of 12 teams.
